Welcome to jl_spectra_2_structure's documentation!
==================================================
This is documentation for https://github.com/JLans/jl_spectra_2_structure.
 jl_spectra_2_structure trains neural network models to learn quantitative descriptions of surface coordination
 for either extended surfaces or nanoparticles. The model is trained on complex synthetic IR data (secondary data).
 A class is provided for generating complex (secondary) data from low coverage dft frequency and intensity data (primary data).
 Another class is provided for generating the primary data from forces on atoms and integrated charges computed by vasp and chargemol respectively.
